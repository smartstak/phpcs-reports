== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn’t form data sent to Google Sheets—or just spinning indefinitely? =

This usually happens when:

- Your Google authentication token needs reauthorization. Visit the plugin settings and reauthorize.
- Google Sheets and Drive APIs are not enabled on your Google account. Ensure both are activated in your Google Cloud Console.

= Can I reorder/add/edit the sheets header columns in Google Spreadsheets? =

These features are include in [Pro Version](https://www.wpsyncsheets.com/wpsyncsheets-for-elementor/)

= Does this plugin work with Elementor Free? =
No. This plugin requires **Elementor Pro** and is specifically built to integrate with Elementor Pro Forms.

= Can I sync multiple Elementor forms to different Google Sheets? =
Yes. You can map each Elementor Pro Form to its own Google Spreadsheet or worksheet.

= Are uploaded files saved and added to Google Sheets? =
Yes, in the Pro version. File uploads are saved in the plugin folder, and a link is automatically added to the Google Sheet entry.

= Can I freeze the sheet header row? =
Yes. The plugin includes an option to freeze or unfreeze the header row in Google Sheets.

= What happens if the form’s confirmation email fails—will entries still sync? =
Yes. The plugin sends data to Google Sheets before the form confirmation email is triggered, so your entries are safe even if the email fails.

= Can I view, clear, or download the connected Google Sheet? =
Yes. You can access your linked Google Sheet from the plugin settings with options to view, clear, or download it.

= What should I do if I see a “This app isn’t verified” warning from Google? =
If you created the Google API credentials yourself, click “Advanced” and then “Go to project” to continue. It’s safe if you’re the app owner.

= Why is there a "range exceeds grid limits" error in Sheets? =
This occurs when the sheet reaches its maximum row or column limit. Simply increase the number of rows in your Google Sheet to fix this.
